Through coordinated handling, our team adopts the investor\'s objectives in order to optimize the budget, programming, design, functionality, and required quality. </p>

<p>Implementing PDRI (Project Definition Rate Index) procedures produce benefits and adds value. Likewise, applying BIM (Building Information Modeling) to the project documentation and to the management of costs and programming, creates similar results. </p>

<p> the projectâ€™s initial decision-making process is a key factor in all the proceeding fazes. The SYASA team prepares the programming, detailed budgets, cash flow projections, and they identify
 the most beneficial resources when it comes to time and money. </p>

<p>In simple terms: the pre-construction work here at SYASA guarantees achieving all the project\'s goals. </p>'
